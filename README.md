# üß† Debiasing Word Embeddings with GloVe

A hands-on implementation of techniques to detect and reduce **gender bias** in word embeddings using GloVe vectors. Inspired by the research paper _‚ÄúMan is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings‚Äù_ by Bolukbasi et al. (2016), this project showcases how bias creeps into machine learning models, and how we can fix it.

## Project Overview

In this notebook, we explore and correct bias in pretrained word vectors using the following steps:

- Perform **analogy tasks** to highlight biased relationships (e.g., `man : doctor :: woman : ?`)
- Apply **neutralization** to remove gender direction from gender-neutral words  
- Apply **equalization** to make gender-specific pairs like `king/queen`, `he/she` symmetrically aligned  
- Visualize before-and-after results using **bar plots**

## Key Techniques Implemented

| Technique        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `cosine_similarity()` | Measures directional bias of word vectors |
| `neutralize()`         | Removes bias from gender-neutral words |
| `equalize()`           | Symmetrically aligns gendered word pairs |
| `Analogy Solver`       | Checks how bias affects predictions in analogy tasks |

## Visual Illustrations

To help understand how debiasing works, here are some visual explanations of the concepts applied:

### Neutralization

This process removes gender components from gender-neutral words so their embeddings lie orthogonal to the gender direction.

---

### Equalization

Equalization aligns gender-specific word pairs (e.g., `man/woman`, `king/queen`) such that they are **equidistant** from the gender axis.

## Visualization: Bias in Gendered Word Pairs

The plot below displays the cosine similarity of several gendered word pairs (e.g., `man/woman`, `king/queen`, `he/she`) with the gender direction vector, both **before** and **after** applying the **equalization algorithm**.

This clearly illustrates how equalization balances the representation of both words in a pair along the gender subspace ‚Äî ensuring that their embeddings are equidistant from the gender axis.
